        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>
            From the flickering pixels of Atari's <span class="highlight">Night Driver</span> to the lush 3D worlds of Sega's <span class="highlight">Sonic Adventure</span>, video games have undergone a remarkable transformation in their quest to immerse players. This exhibition explores how technological innovation and creative design converged across four generations of gaming hardware to create increasingly sophisticated experiences that captured players' imaginations and emotions.

            The evolution of gaming immersion is not merely a story of advancing graphics. It's a narrative of how developers learned to harness limitations—whether hardware constraints of early systems or the creative challenges of new dimensions—to forge deeper connections between players and virtual worlds. Early titles like <span class="highlight">Donkey Kong</span> and <span class="highlight">Baseball</span> established foundational principles of engagement through simple mechanics and clear objectives. The <span class="highlight">NES era</span> introduced narrative depth and character development, with games like <span class="highlight">The Legend of Zelda</span> and <span class="highlight">Final Fantasy</span> creating emotional investment through storytelling and world-building. The <span class="highlight">PlayStation revolution</span> brought three-dimensional spaces that transformed how players perceived and navigated game environments, while the <span class="highlight">Dreamcast era</span> refined these experiences into seamless, cinematic adventures.

            "Immersion in gaming evolves not through technology alone, but through the thoughtful marriage of technical possibility and human psychology."
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Each artifact in this collection represents a pivotal moment where developers pushed boundaries to create more compelling, emotionally resonant experiences. From the tension of <span class="highlight">Night Driver's</span> minimalist night racing to the exploratory freedom of <span class="highlight">Tomb Raider's</span> ancient ruins, these games demonstrate how immersion evolved through careful attention to player psychology, technological possibility, and artistic vision. The progression from simple visual feedback to complex emotional engagement reveals gaming's unique capacity to transform players from passive observers into active participants in digital worlds.
        </p>

            This exhibition invites you to consider not just how games changed technically, but how they transformed culturally—as spaces where players didn't merely interact with systems, but became emotionally invested participants in digital worlds. By examining these fifteen artifacts across four generations, we reveal gaming's continuous quest to create spaces where players don't just play, but truly belong. Through this journey, we witness the medium's maturation from novelty entertainment to a powerful storytelling platform capable of profound emotional impact and cultural significance.
